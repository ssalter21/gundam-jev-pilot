# TCG Engines

This repository contains the open-source engine and simulator workspaces used by
TCG Online. It includes game rules, card definitions, adapters, shared simulator
contracts, and test tooling for the public parts of the project.

The production web app, API, gateway, reverse proxy, workers, auth, matchmaking
services, infrastructure, and deployment configuration are private and are not
included here.

## Workspaces

- `submodules/agnostic-simulator` - shared protocol, simulator contracts,
  runtime adapters, simulator UI primitives, and agent tooling.
- `submodules/lorcana` - Lorcana engine, cards, simulator, replay tooling, and
  tests.
- `submodules/cyberpunk` - Cyberpunk cards, engine, parser/scraper tooling, and
  server adapter.
- `submodules/flesh-and-blood` - Flesh and Blood catalog types, cards, rules
  engine runtime, and ingestion tooling.
- `submodules/grand-archive` - Grand Archive catalog types, cards, rules
  engine runtime, and ingestion tooling.
- `submodules/gundam` - Gundam engine, cards, simulator, tooling, and server
  adapter.
- `submodules/naruto` - Naruto cards, provisional rules engine, and tests.
- `submodules/one-piece` - One Piece simulator, engine, cards, types,
  and utilities.
- `submodules/riftbound` - Riftbound catalog types, cards, and ingestion
  tooling.

## Simulator Support

- **Supported:** Lorcana, Cyberpunk, Gundam, Naruto (provisional preview
  rules), One Piece, and — newly added — Flesh and Blood.
- **Not yet implemented:** Grand Archive, Riftbound, and Star Wars
  Unlimited. Their engine and card workspaces ship in this repository
  first, and their simulators are still in development.

## Requirements

- Node.js 24.x
- pnpm 10.33.x
- Bun, for packages that use Bun-powered scripts
- Vite+ (`vp`), installed by the package manager in each workspace

## Setup

Each exported subdirectory is its own pnpm workspace. Install dependencies from
the workspace you are changing:

```bash
pnpm --dir submodules/cyberpunk install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm --dir submodules/agnostic-simulator install --frozen-lockfile
```

For cross-game simulator work, install and build game workspaces before running
the agnostic simulator checks.

## Validation

The root package provides convenience wrappers:

```bash
pnpm run ci:cyberpunk:check
pnpm run ci:gundam:check
pnpm run ci:lorcana:check
pnpm run ci:one-piece:check
pnpm run ci:agnostic:check
pnpm run ci:public
```

Run the focused workspace check first. Broader checks are useful before opening
or merging a public PR.

## Contributions

Public contributions should target engines, cards, rules, adapters, shared
simulator contracts, tests, and developer tooling in the exported workspaces.
Production service, account, deployment, and infrastructure changes are out of
scope for this repository.
